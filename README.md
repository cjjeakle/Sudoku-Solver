Sudoku-Solver
=============

A c++ project intended to solve sudoku puzzles

In its current state the program solves simples sudoku puzzles
Test board is a simple test sudoku board to paste when prompted for input

Changes to make:
-> find a way to identify two squares in a row or col of a sub-board that have an identical two possibilities, eliminate using these
-> clean up code, possibly divide into multiple files, and possibly allow for file and console input (is there a real need?)
-> add error checking of user input (could prove quite complex)

->EVENTUALLY: port to javascript, make a mobile compatible website
