Sudoku-Solver
=============

A c++ project intended to solve sudoku puzzles

*The program can now solve "hard" puzzles from websodoku.com, more test cases of the highest difficulty are still needed
*If a square's solution cannot be found, its coordinates (in a 1-9 format) and the possibilities left for it are printed

Changes to make:

* clean up code, possibly divide into multiple files, and possibly allow for file and console input (is there a real need?)
* add error checking of user input (could prove quite complex)

* EVENTUALLY: port to javascript, make a mobile compatible website
